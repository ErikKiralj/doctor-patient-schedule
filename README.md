# Web application for automatic appointment scheduling between doctors and patients

Internet application for automatic appointment scheduling, implemented through the concept of booking appointments for patients for a specific service offered by each doctor. The application is created in Laravel open-source PHP framework based on MVC architecture. The purpose of the application is to make signing up for a specific service easier for patients. Providers are added to the system, they add the services they provide, and each service offered has its own duration. Users register, search for services matching their parameters, and schedule an appointment for the requested service. Availiable appointments are generated through the algorithm, which is the main part of this project. The algorithm searches the database and returns an availiable appointment, before the previously existing appointment, between two appointments, or at the end of the last appointment.
